# Env-shelf

Env-shelf is a desktop app for managing local `.env` files safely and quickly.  
It scans a selected folder, groups projects that contain `.env` files, and lets you edit them with guardrails.

## What It Does
- Scans a root folder for `.env` files and groups them by project.
- Opens and edits files with a structured table view and a raw text view.
- Shows a diff of changes against the original file.
- Detects duplicate keys.
- Masks secret values by default, with a toggle to reveal them.
- Creates an optional backup when saving.
- Supports search, add, update, and delete of env variables.
- Lets you revert to the last saved version.

## Tech
- Tauri + Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS UI

## Build and Run on macOS

### 1) Install prerequisites
- Xcode Command Line Tools:
  - Run `xcode-select --install`
- Rust + Cargo (required by Tauri):
  - Run:
    ```bash
    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
    cargo --version
    rustc --version
    ```
  - If `cargo` is still not found, restart your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
    ```
- Node.js (18+ recommended)
- pnpm (recommended): `npm install -g pnpm`

### 2) Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3) Build the desktop app
```bash
pnpm build
```

The packaged app will be generated by Tauri (check `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`).

### Optional: Run in dev mode
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Optional: Run only the web UI (without Tauri/Rust)
```bash
pnpm web:dev
```

## Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Select a folder to scan.
3. Pick a project and an `.env` file.
4. Edit variables in the table or raw view.
5. Review diff and save (optionally with backup).
